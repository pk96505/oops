Q1.An electricity board charges the following rates to domestic users to discourage large consumption of energy:
For the first 100 units   -  60P per unit
For next 200 units        -  80P per unit
Beyond 300 units          -  90P per unit
All users are charged a minimum of Rs. 50.00. If the total amount is more than Rs. 300.00 then an additional surcharge of 15% is added.
Write a program to read the names of users and number of units consumed and print out the charges with names.
